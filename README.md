# Keylogger Cybersecurity Project  

This repository contains a basic keylogger program created during my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech. The project demonstrates my understanding of Python programming, system monitoring, and ethical hacking principles.  

## Features  
- Logs all keystrokes on the system.  
- Saves the logged keystrokes to a file (`key_log.txt`).  
- Allows termination of the program by pressing the `ESC` key.  

## Usage  

### Prerequisites  
1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the `pynput` library by running:  
  ```bash
  pip install pynput

### Running the Script  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tholumuzikhuboni/PRODIGY_CY_04.git
   cd PRODIGY_CY_04
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
3. The keystrokes will be logged in a file named `key_log.txt` in the same directory.

### Stopping the Script  
Press the `ESC` key to terminate the program.  

### Ethical Considerations  
This project is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have proper authorization before deploying this program.  

### Project Context  
This project was developed as the fourth project of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech. It highlights my skills in Python and cybersecurity practices.
